# Risk Assessment Algorithms in the Criminal Justice System

# Project Description: 
Risk assessment algorithms are used by the courts, usually judges and prosecutors and are  designed to predict the probablity of someone doing a crime again based on an individuals attributes(demographics, criminal history etc). They are bascially tool used to determine wether how likely it is someone will do a crime again. These algorithms supposedly lessen bias and provide more accurate results so that judges make better decisions. Yet upon further research they seem ot be used at the conveinince of the legal system and can either be used or discarded whenever. So I would like to evaluate/emulate these risk assessment algorithms to look how accurately they can "predict" wether someone is going to do a crime again and show how they bascially regurgitate, reiterate and exacerbate the already vast issues in the criminal justice system. 

# Project Goals
1. Evaulate literature and research on risk assesment algorithms and their impact 
2. Possibly try to mimic a RAA with several datasets and see what it would produce
3.  Evaulte the effects and issues in blindly using such algorithms in crimial justice system and show how these algorithms, the data used and such are as biased as the people who are using/creating them.
